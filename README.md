## Lab Questions

### 1 - Why does the Modulo Counter actually divide clocks by 2 * Count?

Because each flip-flop in the chain divides the frequency by 2

### 2 - Why does the ring counter's output go to all 1s on the first clock cycle?

A ring counter goes to all 1s on the first clock cycle only when something in the design or initialization is off

### 3 - What width of ring counter would you use to get to an output of ~1KHz?

clk/1000
